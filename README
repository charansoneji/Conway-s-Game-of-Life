------------------------- Conway's Game of Life in C ---------------------------

    There are two main files in the repository. The first one is the `MPI 
    implementation` folder which contains another readme file which contains the
    instructions for execution in MPI environment. It requires compilation of 
    the cpp program followed by exection of the input file.The directory 
    contains code for scaling the Conway's Game of Life C code, life.c.
    You can cause the program to output the Game of Life grid at each time step
    by uncommenting the relevant line in the Makefile.
    The code can be made into serial, MPI, OpenMP, and hybrid executables. To
    compile each of these, enter 'make serial', 'make mpi', 'make openmp', or
    'make hybrid', respectively.  To remove all executables from the directory,
    enter 'make clean'.  To re-make all of the executables at once, enter 'make
    all'.
    The other file is the `Time comparison` folder which contains the serial as
    well as paralled execution of the program according to the rules and a normal 
    compiler can be used to run the programs and just wait for the compilation 
    to finish in the terminal. It shall give the total time of implementation 
    returned.
